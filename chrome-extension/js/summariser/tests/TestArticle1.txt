FORTNITE is taking over, but you'll be amazed by just how much money the console, PC and mobile game is making.

Epic Games has seen its stock rise and rise this year as the free-to-play battle royale blockbuster continues to dominate all things gaming.

And as millions of addicted players across the globe plough endless hours into the title, where 100 battle it out online at a time in a fight to the death, the money just keeps rolling in thanks to buyable add-ons.

The game has now earned more than $1.2billion (£900million) since its launch in September and is on track for $2bn by year end.

And new analysis from Bloomberg suggests that with Fortnite’s success, Epic Games is now worth over $8.5 billion.

This value is based on all of Epic’s revenues, including its Unreal Engine which many developers use to make games for consoles.

Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, created the company in his parent’s basement 27 years ago.

Sweeney is currently the controlling shareholder of Epic Games.

Bloomberg said that making Fortnite free to play, with in-game purchases, has paid off and made him a billionaire.

Instead of shelling out upwards of £40 for the game, players buy online V-bucks, a virtual currency they can exchange during play for outfits, called skins, celebratory dances or special missions that can cost as much as £20 each.

“On the revenue side, they’ve done something that’s really unique, which is come up with a perception of exclusivity,” said Michael Pachter, a video game analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.

Many accessories in the Fortnite shop are available on a limited basis, prompting players to buy before coveted items disappear from virtual shelves.

Pachter said: “If you see another player in a leopard skin and go to the store and see it’s no longer available, you think, Shoot, I’ve got to move on it next time.”

While most games hit peak popularity shortly after launch, Fortnite was still drawing millions of new users six months on, thanks to a broadly appealing aesthetic that’s more comic mischief than graphic violence.

Celebrity fans such as rapper Drake have pushed it further into mainstream consciousness.

As a game that’s social, easy to play and hard to master, it’s been a particular hit with school-age kids, raising concerns from teachers and parents reporting obsessive playing during class.

And counselling experts have this week warned parents to limit their kids time with the game as they see a boom in gaming addictions.

Analyst in the Bloomberg piece suggested that if Epic Games were put up for sale, it would be worth around $14billion (£10.6bn) based on similar values that EA, which makes Battlefield, and Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty, are worth.

They also added that even if Fortnite’s momentum slowed down, the company could still expect to earn $1 billion a year from the title’s in-game sales.

New data also released by Sensor Tower recently stated that Fortnite on mobile makes around $2million a day, up from $1.5million earlier this year, thanks to Season 5.
